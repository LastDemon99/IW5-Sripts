# <a name="key-features"></a>Key Features
- Players cannot choose preset or custom classes. Everyone starts with a Skorpion as a primary weapon and an usp as a secondary weapon.
- Script spawns random items in different zones, once a player picks up a weapon or perk, the fx location turns red, after a time of 25 seconds, then regenerates the same weapon, or 
perk.
- The way to pick up an item is by using the f key, if you don't have the weapon it will be replaced by the one you have in your hand, otherwise it will just fill your ammo, likewise only if you don't have the weapon or perk will you be able to use the item.
- The only available perks are FastReload, QuickDraw, Stalker, BulletAccuracy, Quieter.
- Players can jump twice the normal height and falling damage is negated, jump slow has disable.
- The script only works for stock maps, i have to add more zones and more maps, by default the "drop zone" mode zones are used, I will update this in the future.
